/**
 * Defines a registry of state for services.
 * <p>
 * Individual service modules need some backing key-value state for storing their own persistent state.
 * The merkle tree state is owned by the platform modules, with an implementation of
 * {@code SwirldState} being constructed by the application module. The application module implements
 * this interface, and gives an instance to service modules during their construction. Each
 * service module can look up its own state in the registry and, if that state is not present in the
 * register, create and register it.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible for the service module to replace the state it had previously registered, or
 * delete it. This is useful during migration at startup.

public interface StateRegistry {
	/**
	 * Called by the service during initialization to get a {@link State} from the registry,
	 * or register a new one if none is present, or migrate one if desired. The service will call this
	 * method with a {@code stateKey} that represents a state that it knows about. The
	 * {@code createOrMigrate} lambda is then invoked by the registry for the following two conditions:
	 * <ol>
	 *     <li>A {@link State} for that {@code stateKey} was found. The callback will be provided
	 *     with a {@link StateBuilder} that can be used to create a new {@link State} to replace
	 *     this one if desired. The {@link State} found will also be supplied. The state returned
	 *     by the lambda will be the one stored in the registry. If null, nothing will be registered
	 *     and any state that was registered will be removed.</li>
	 *     <li>A {@link State} was not found. The callback will be provided with a
	 *     {@link StateBuilder} but with no {@link State}. The callback can create and return the
	 *     state to use, or it can return null if it wants no state registered.</li>
	 *
	 * </ol>
	 * <p>
	 * For example, suppose my service used to have an in-memory state but wants to migrate to an
	 * on-disk state. It may be that the service is starting with an existing state (upgrade), or
	 * with no existing state (genesis). In either case, my code may look like this:
	 * <pre>
	 *     registry.getOrRegister(MyStateKey.SOME_STATE, (builder, existingState) -> {
	 *     // DOES NOT WORK. I need to be able to also distinguish the case where it is already
	 *     // an on-disk state. That implies different keys (yuck) or versions (also yuck).
	 *     // What else can I do?
	 *        if (existingState.isPresent()) {
	 *            final var newStateOnDisk = builder.onDisk(MyStateKey.SOME_STATE)
	 *            		.keySerializer(...)
	 *            	    .valueSerializer(...)
	 *            	    .build();
	 *
	 *            // ... write code here to migrate from existingState to newStateOnDisk
	 *            return newStateOnDisk;
	 *        }
	 *     });
	 * </pre>
